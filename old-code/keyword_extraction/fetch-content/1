The iPhone 11 has one big feature that will really matter to users, and more so than any other element: it's got a killer price.

While the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max steal the show in terms of headline spec, the new iPhone has a lower price than the iPhone XR (the surprise hit from last year) and yet improves the spec in a few key areas.

It's got faster innards, a much, much improved camera and comes with iOS 13 as standard - and does so at a price that allows users to get a new iPhone for less than most top-end phones out there.

That said, it's far from the most advanced iPhone out there, so has Apple got a hit on its hands, or is it something that doesn't quite hit the spot?

The iPhone 11 release date is set for September 20, which is good news for anyone looking to get hold of Apple's affordable new iPhone, as the XR hit stores later than the XS in 2018.

If you're ready to make a commitment to the handset, iPhone 11 pre-orders open on September 13 and - don't forget - it will come with a year's subscription to Apple TV Plus in the US.

The iPhone 11 price is hugely impressive in the US, where it starts at $699 for the 64GB storage model - we can't begin to call this phone 'cheap', but that's a drop of $50 over the iPhone XR, and it's an incredible thing for Apple to do here.

In other regions the iPhone 11 price is still lower than the XR, but the saving isn't as great. The 64GB iPhone 11 will set you back £729 in the UK and AU$1,199 in Australia, which represents a saving of £20 and AU$30 respectively over XR.

There are, as usual, a range of storage options to go for - with the aforementioned 64GB model joined by 128GB ($749, £779, AU$1,279) and 256GB ($849, £879, AU$1,449) versions, if you’re looking to spend more money to get extra storage.

If you're in the UK and primed to purchase the new iPhone on release, you can register your interest with certain retailers so that you'll be the first to hear about their best prices. Vodafone and Carphone Warehouse both have such pre-registration pages, while Mobiles.co.uk will give you £30 cashback if you pre-register with them and then go on to purchase the phone.
